# CP-Solutions
 A collection of my solutions to online judges.

Generally, C++ solutions are higher quality than Java solutions. 

- C++ solutions are significantly more recent than Java solutions.
- Java has more solutions to "easy" problems, while C++ has more solutions to harder problems.


If you are trying to copy solutions without time spent for forethought, you will only be hurting yourself in the long run.
